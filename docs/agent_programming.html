Agent Programming in Java
</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME='Background'><H3>Background</H3></A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	There are a variety of agent and application servers currently available to the
	Java community. Most of these platforms are monolithic in nature, and often
	require the adoption of additional features, programming idioms, and setup
	procedures that are not critical to the overall application design.
	<P>
	In almost all cases, what should be a simple application ends up as a large,
	expensive, and complex procedure requiring a learning
	investment above and beyond the standard JDK. Some of these platforms even
	task the developer with learning another language or scripting environment
	that has nothing at all to do with Java. Others involve a proprietary build
	process or source code preprocessor adding complexity to the build process.
	<P>
	Few of these platforms are truly cross-platform compatible, with support
	for only the most popular Java-enabled platforms. Few of them are small
	enough to be useable on embedded devices. Few of them offer unlimited
	compatibility with other platforms and existing APIs. Most of these platforms
	are restrictive in nature.
	<P>
	While there are also a variety of licensing options available, most of them
	are expensive and/or restrictive in some way which protects the interests of
	the platform vendor. Often these interests are in conflict with the developers
	needs and available resources. A platform which may perfectly fit the
	requirements of a specific application may require the purchase of costly
	software licenses before any real benefits can be realized.
	<P>
	The Comet Way Agent Kernel fills in the gaps by providing an open and consistent
	environment where agents can access existing java-enabled technologies and
	benefit from their shared use.

<A NAME='WhatAreAgents'><H3>What Are Agents?</H3></A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	The term <I>agent</I> has been used and reused to describe many types of applications
	and software behavior. A fairly universal view is that agents perform tasks
	on behalf of their user. This is the basic definition of an agent under the
	Comet Way Agent Kernel.
	<P>
	Some agents are <I>autonomous</I> and are able to perform tasks independently
	from user interaction. These agents are essentially setup once, and continue
	to function without further intervention. They are most useful in server
	applications, or in any situation where user-interaction is not readily
	available.
	<P>
	Some agents are <I>mobile</I> and are able to move freely, or with some
	restrictions, between different agent servers. Sometimes only their data
	is moved, and in other cases their complete state and byte-code are moved.
	In some applications, mobility is the primary feature necessary to realize
	the benefits of agent programming.
	<P>
	Some agents communicate with each other in a cooperative and/or competitive
	fashion.There are many agent platforms focused on harvesting the benefits
	of sophisticated agent interactions relying heavily on their social nature
	to realize their benefits.
	<P>
	The Comet Way Agent Kernel makes no serious attempt at modeling any of these agent
	types, but rather provides most of the underlying features necessary for
	developing any kind of agent. All types of agents running under the Comet
	Way Agent Kernel can peacefully co-exist with each other, sharing the full benefits
	of these and other agent types as necessary. Rarely does one specific approach
	satisfy the needs of all applications.

<A NAME='AgentProgramming'><H3>What Is Agent Programming?</H3></A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Comet Way Agent Kernel supports a methodology known as <I>agent programming</I> which
	provides a context for componentizing application functionality through the
	abstraction of these features as <I>agents</I>. Individual agents
	are typically focused on the performance of a specific task or domain, and
	provide the basic building blocks necessary for creating increasingly
	sophisticated and complex applications. Agent programming is a simple and
	effective approach for writing component software because it allows you to
	pick and choose each component as necessary, configuring each one to work
	effectively in their environment.
	<P>
	Modularity and reusability is one of the most promised, yet rarely achived,
	benefits of the Java language. The Comet Way Agent Kernel makes good on this promise
	by providing a consistent model for writing component software as agents.
	By taking advantage of proven APIs and platforms, these agents can quickly
	to extend their effective reach while providing a level of stability and
	compatibility across various Java technologies.
