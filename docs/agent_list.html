<A NAME='KernelAgents'><H3>Kernel Agents</H3></A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Agent programming is made possible by the Kernel Agents, which are responsible
	for many of the critical low-level agent operations. The most important agent
	is the Agent Kernel itself which is responsible for creating, starting, stopping,
	and destroying all agents. The Agent Kernel's first responsibility is creating
	and starting the Startup Agent, which loads and starts all the other agents. You
	will note that these Kernel Agents play a fundamental role in supporting both the
	<A href="#WebAgents">Web</A> and <A href="#EmailAgents">Email</A> agents,
	which are described in later sections.

	</H5>

	This section briefly describes the role of each of the Kernel Agents:
	<P>

	<H4>Agent</H4>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		All agents implement the Agent model and are capable of using their
		own properties and state information to provide	appropriate functionality.
		Agents provide methods that are critical to their life-cycle and operation. By default. each agent possess the following properties:
		<UL>
		<LI>name - the agent's internal name to be displayed in agent output (default: same as class name) 
		<LI>id - the agent's id (default: assigned by the agent kernel) 
		<LI>hide_println - disables println output if set to true (default: false) 
		<LI>hide_debug - disables debug output if set to true (default: false) 
		<LI>hide_warning - disables warning output if set to true (default: false) 
		</UL>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<H4>Agent Kernel</H4>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		The Agent Kernel is responsible for managing the life-cycle of all agents,
		but it does not otherwise keep track of these agents, or attempts to manage
		any other aspect about them. The Agent Kernel is an Agent itself, and
		adheres to standard agent interfaces.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<H4>Startup Agent</H4>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		This Startup Agent is created and started by the Agent Kernel. It is responsible for
		loading property files from the startup directory (text files ending in
		.startup), sorting them alphabetically, and then creating and starting
		an agent for each using the Agent Kernel. Each new agent is defined by properties
		(Props) loaded from each file. The startup process is synchronous, ensuring that
		each startup agent is loaded and started before the next. You can artificially
		specify loading order by prefixing .startup filenames with numbers
		(ie: 100_StartupAgent.startup).
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<H4>Service Manager and Service Agents</H4>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		The Service Manager provides a directory service were agents can
		register themselves as a service for other agents to lookup and use.
		Service Agents can be extended to automatically register an agent
		as a service with the Service Manager, and contain methods that
		can be used by subclasses to manually register and unregister themselves.
		Most agents are Service Agents because of the social needs of agents
		that depend on other types of agents.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
      
        <H4>Agent Replicator</H4>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
		An Agent Replicator can be used to create and start multiple instances of
		another type of agent. This is a common activity when creating a pool of
		agents for parallel agent architectures.
        </BLOCKQUOTE>

	<H4>Scheduler and Scheduled Agents</H4>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		The Scheduler provides scheduling services to wakeup Scheduled Agents
		using a customized schedule. The Scheduler automatically registers itself with
		Service Manager when it starts, and Scheduled Agents automatically schedule
		themselves when they are started.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<H4>Request Agent</H4>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		Request Agents can be extended to provide a method for passing generic
		messages to agents as an Agent Request. The Agent Request holds references
		to passed parameters and provides support for returning streamed output.
		Request Agents register themselves with the Service Manager upon starting
		(they are a subclass of Service Agent) and are commonly used by both
		<A href="#WebAgents">Web</A> and <A href="#EmailAgents">Email</A> agents
		for handling network requests.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<A NAME='WebAgents'><H3>Web Agents</H3></A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Web Agents represent a set of agents that cooperate to implement
	the functionality of a typical web server. Because each significant
	feature is implemented as an agent, only the required functionality
	needs to be loaded for a specific application. This keeps things lightweight
	and extensible, as existing components can also be replaced by others with
	enhanced functionality.
	<P>
	These Web Agents pass HTTP request information to Request Agents
	which can be extended to generate dynamic content for HTML, WAP, or even
	XML applications. The Web Server agent itself can be easily extended
	to support SSL using third party encryption libraries.

	<H4>Supported Features</H4>
	<UL>
		<LI>Customizable Request Agents (Easier than servlets!)
		<LI>File Serving
		<LI>Server Redirection
		<LI>Proxying
		<LI>Client Authentication
		<LI>Supports WAP and XML
		<LI>Multihoming
		<LI>Access Logging
		<LI>Web-based Use Statistics
		<LI>Sessions (Using Session Manager)
		<LI>Cookies
		<LI>Easily Extended To Use a SSL Socket Library</LI>       
	</UL>

	The following diagram illustrates the Web Agents including the
	<A href="#KernelAgents">Kernel Agents</A> they rely upon.
	Request Agent is extended to handle HTTP based Agent Requests to
	provide dynamic content generation. These Web Request Agents register
	themselves to handle specific URLs (like a CGI script) and wait for
	the next request to handle content generation for that URL from the Web Server.

	<P><I>Note: In this diagram, involvement of the Service Manager	is implied but not drawn.
	The Service Manager is the center of the Web Agent programming.</I></P>

		Web Server Agents and Their Relationships
	</H5>

	This section briefly describes the role of each of the Web Agents:

	<H4>Web Server</H4>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		The Web Server is responsible for listening for incoming HTTP connections
		and directing the request to the agent responsible for handling the request.
		The Web Server passes these requests to Request Agents which have registered themselves
		with the Service Manager. The Web Server agent can be easily extended to support
		more secure SSL sockets provided by third-party APIs
		(i.e. <A href="http://www.phaos.com/e_security/prod_ssl.html">Phaos SSLava<FONT SIZE=-2><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT></A>).
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	
	<H4> Log Viewer Agent</H4>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		This agent registers itself into the ServiceManager and accepts http requests to view information 
		stored in log files. Given a directory, this agent will look for all the files in that directory and treat 
		them as log files. The agent uses a mapping which provides information about how these files should 
		be displayed. The logfile mapping maps a name to a text pattern. The agent will display the names and 
		the matching lines of the log files. 
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<H4>HTTP File Server</H4>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		The HTTP File Server responds by streaming back a file requested by the Web Server.
		It serves files from a specified directory, and also handles directory indexing
		(when enabled). It is not necessary to start the File Server agent unless static
		files or graphics need to be served.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	
	<H4>HTTP Put</H4>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		This agent can be loaded to support traditional HTTP Put functionality, saving files received to the specified "html_directory". 
		You must specify this agent's service name for the "put_agent" property in the webserver. This agent can be easily replaced 
		by a different RequestAgent for custom handling of HTTP Put requests
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<H4>HTTP Redirect</H4>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		This Request Agent is used by the WebServer. The WebServer uses this agent to determine whether a web 
		request should be redirected and if so, the request is given to this agent for it to handle. 
		This agent requires a file which lists the requests which to redirect. Requests with more than one redirect
		(listed in the file) will be cycled. The file format is name value pairs delimited by newlines and lines starting with '#' are ignored. 
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<H4>HTTP Authentication</H4>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		The HTTP Authentication agent is used to provide support for client
		authentication where the browser pops up a password dialog. When the Web Server
		is using this agent, all unique accesses are password authorized based
		on a list of protected <I>realms</I> read at startup from a text file.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<H4>HTTP Proxy</H4>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		The HTTP Proxy forwards specific URL requests to other web servers using HTTP.
		On startup, a list of proxy aliases is read from a text file.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME='EmailAgents'><H3>E-mail Agents</H3></A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Email Agents can be used individually or collectively to provide a variety
	of features and services to agent applications. The Send Email Agent can send email based
	messages to people and other email-based services. Email messages can be received
	directly through SMTP by the Receive Email Agent and routed to Request Agents registered
	with the Service Manager with own unique email address. The Email Bug Report Agent
	is perfect for reporting bug and status information.

	<H5 ALIGN='center'>

		E-mail Agents and Their Relationships
	</H5>
	
	This section briefly describes the role of each of the Email Agents: 

	<H4>Email Reporter Agent</H4>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		This is a Reporter Agent logs AK agent output to sequentially named text files. 
		Upon loading, this agent replaces the default Reporter Agent. 
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	

	<H4>Receive Email Agent</H4>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		This agent opens up a server socket to receive SMTP requests and routes
		them to agents who have registered themselves with the Service Manager
		under a unique email address.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	
	<H4>Receive POP3 Email Agent</H4>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		This agent opens up a server socket to a 
      		POP3 server, downloads new email and routes them to agents who have registered themselves 
		with the Service Manager under a unique email
		address.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<H4>Send Email Agent</H4>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		This agent queues up email messages and sends them to the smtp_host at regular intervals.
		There are a variety of properties that can be configured which define how and when these
		messages are sent. This agent implements the SendEmailInterface and registers with the Service 
		Manager for other agents to use. 
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<H4>Auto Reply Agent</H4>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		This agent registers itself as an email address that is received
		by the Receive Email Agent. When it receives an email message,
		it automatically replies with a configurable response. This agent
		can be extended to interpret the message and provide a dynamically
		generated response instead.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<H4>Email Bug Report Agent</H4>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		This agent registers itself with the Service Manager as a Bug Reporter
		and collects bug "reports" from other agents. On a configurable schedule,
		these bug reports are put into an email message and sent to a list of
		recipients. It is very useful for monitoring the status of autonomous
		agent applications.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<H4>Request Dumper Agent</H4>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
  
		This is a simple Request Agent that dumps received Agent Request information
		to the console. It is useful for viewing and/or debugging email messages
		received by the Receive Email Agent. <I>Note: It can also be used to dump
		requests from the Web Server.</I> 
    
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<H4>Request Filter Agent</H4>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		This agent proxies requests to another request agent and in the process, it caches 
		the props for each request. Cached requests are filtered depending on the filter_interval 
		property and the requests that made it through the filter are emailed to the list of email addresses 
		provided by the recipients property. 
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME='SwingAgents'><H3>Swing Agents</H3></A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Swing Agents interact with a user using the Swing API.

	<H4>AbstractJFrameAgent</H4>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		This abstract Agent contains basic functionality useable
		by an agent that manages a JFrame. Methods in this abstract
		implementation can be overridden to create and manage any subclass of JFrame.
		Convenience methods are provided for handling menus and the menu bar,
		as well as the Look and Feel used by Swing.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	   
	<H4>AbstractJFrameControler</H4>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		This class acts as an agent-based proxy for a standard AWT frame. It creates an 
		inner class called ControlledFrame whose paint method is forwarded to the 
		drawFrame method which is intended to be overridden by subclasses of this class.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<H4>StartupEditor</H4>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		This is a Startup Agent which can be used to edit Agent Kernel
		.startup files. To use this agent, you must invoke the com.cometway.ak.AK
		class using the -startup_agent com.cometway.swing.Startup editor option.
		This will load the current startup configuration into the Startup Editor
		application, where changes to the agent Props files can be made using
		a Swing based GUI. Saving the configuration will delete the old .startup
		files, and write out the new configuration.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	
	<H4>Lightbox</H4>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		This agent displays a frame that contains Lights, or more accurately
		colored squares, that are drawn in a grid style array. The LightBox
		agent registers itself with the Service Manager so that it may be found
		and used by other agents to display state information.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	
	<H4>PropsEditor</H4>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		This agent is used by the StartupEditor agent application.
		This agent can be used to present a JFrame containing a JTable-based Agent
		Props editor. The edit_props property must be set to reference the Props
		that will be edited before this agent is started.
