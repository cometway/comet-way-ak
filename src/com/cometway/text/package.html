<BODY>
This package contains a model and reference implementation of text buffer that
allows text editor-like functions to a low-level text buffer interface. Some of
the features include text pointers and text ranges which automatically maintain
their correct marker positions within the buffer while the buffers contents are
being changed. Text finders know how to search through the text using user-defined
algorithms. Reference implementations for standard matching and regular expression
based finders are provided. There are also tools for parsing HTML.
