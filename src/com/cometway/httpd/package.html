This package contains agents for building a web server configuration. These agents can be
configured to include a variety of features such as redirection, proxying, multi-homing,
and password authentication. They are compatible for use with any kind of HTTP-based protocol including WAP, SOAP and other forms of XML-based communication. Web request agents can be added to the configuration to support dynamically generated content.
