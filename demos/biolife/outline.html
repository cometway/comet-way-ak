<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Comet Way: The Network IS the Virus</TITLE><BODY><H3>Patrick Bagwell, Paul Cunningham; The Network <U>IS</U> the Virus</H3><I>summercon, June 2, 2001</I><P>The <I>Programmer Agents</I> at Comet Way intend to instruct the unclean masseson the subject of <I>Agent Programming</I>.  Agent Programming is a means ofProblem Solving whereby many small software entities work in concert togenerate some useful result.  Those unclean masses should study their ownbrain units and the society of which they are components for examples ofthis paradigm. Further, Agent Programming lends itself to studies inmutation and software migration, both of which are subjects of ongoingresearch at Comet Way, where Programmer Agents explore connections betweentechnology and biology.  Agent Programming is less than procedural: the goalis a software collective which can find its own path to a solution withoutexplicit help from the Programmer Agent.<HR><H3>Presenters</H3><B>Patrick Bagwell</B> is the principle plebian at Comet Way Inc.  He considershimself no more than a glorified <I>code monkey</I> and in fact is currentlytraining a small team of very intelligent apes to complete his daily tasksso that he can spend more time with his bananas and peanuts.  His principleeducation such as it is took place in the Computer Science Department atCarnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, USA.<P><B>Paul Cunningham</B> is the CTO for Comet Way, and has spent recent yearsdesigning and implementing agent-based applications in Java. He is theauthor of the Comet Way Java Agent Kernel, and is currently porting a 13Kversion to various embedded smart devices. His software designs are ofteninspired by nature, as well as other models observed in real life. Paul hasworked and lived among dozens of code miners and enlightened code monkeys,and sometimes likes to take things apart to see how they work.<HR><H3>Presentation Outline</H3>A rough outline for the Agent presentation at summercon:<OL TYPE='I'>	<LI><B>Introductions</B>&nbsp;	<LI><B>A bit about Minsky, Marvin</B>&nbsp;			<OL TYPE='1'>			<LI><I>The Society of Mind</I>		<LI>The Brain, (complex intuition) as a software community		<LI>Agents are the components, individuals		<LI>Brain agents have EVOLVED to perform highly specialized tasks	</OL>	<LI><B>Beware Coward!</B>&nbsp;	<OL TYPE='1'>		<LI>Agents are software components		<LI>Agents participate in software communities		<LI>Agents are entities with self-contained state and function		<LI>Agents are <U>not</U> procedural; it is not practical to anticipate every possible outcome		<LI>Agents share formal (and sometimes informal) methods of interaction through public interfaces		<LI>Agents can non-deterministically cooperate to solve complex problems		<LI>Agents can evolve through controlled mutation and selection	</OL>	<LI><B>Agent Programming in Java</B>&nbsp;	<OL TYPE='1'>		<LI>OO languages are essential for the evolution of complex ideas		<LI>Java is cross-platform and well supported		<LI>Java is well-suited to provide basic features for Agent Programming		<LI>Agents must be configurable through loosely defined property sets		<LI>Agents must be accountable for their actions (mostly for debugging)		<LI>Agents maintain abstractions that straight OOP cannot through modularity		<LI>Java bytecodes can be dynamcally loaded, even over the network		<LI>Formalizing common problem solving patterns using <I>Agent Programming</I>		<OL TYPE='a'>			<LI>Service Manager (Directory Services, JNDI, JINI, LDAP)			<LI>Scheduler			<LI>Object Manager (ObjectCache, FileObjectManager, JDBCObjectManager)			<LI>Request Agents			<LI>Web Agents (WebServer, Web Scrapers, HTTP communication, XML)			<LI>Email Agents (SendEmail, ReceiveEmail, AutoResponder)			<LI>GUI agents			<LI>Session Manager &amp; Session Reaper			<LI>Mobile Agents (reasons for mobility)		</OL>	</OL>	<LI><B>Ideas and Examples</B>	<OL TYPE='1'>			<LI>Viral agent behavior and network mobility &nbsp;		<LI>Game of Life using agent based mutation and selection &nbsp;		<OL TYPE='a'>			<LI>Brief GOL overview			<LI>Demonstration of traditional GOL			<LI>Demonstation of applying genomes, selection, and mutation to GOL		</OL>		<LI>A Biological Life Model using agents &nbsp;		<OL TYPE='a'>			<LI>Microbiology 101 review			<LI>Using agents to model, view, and control processes			<LI>Demonstration of biological life model using agents			<LI>Compelling parallels found between microbiology and agent programming		</OL>		<LI>Agent Subsumption &nbsp;		<OL TYPE='a'>			<LI>Brooks, Rodney; MIT robotics research			<LI>Subsumption allows low-level processes to block higher ones			<LI>Low-level processes are not concerned with higher level processes			<LI>High-level processes build on low-level behaviors -- but not low-level code			<LI>Undeterministic behaviors often emerge with characteristics of intelligence			<LI>There are many models of subsumption that exist in nature		</OL>		<LI>Video game AI will not be truely compelling until it uses mutation and Agent interaction		<LI>Stuff that groups like distributed.net are doing can be better using mobile Agent techniques	</OL>	<LI><B>Closing</B> &nbsp;	<OL TYPE='1'>			<LI>Something about Comet Way		<LI>Questions &amp; Answers	</OL></OL><HR><P ALIGN='RIGHT'><I>Copyright &copy; 2001, Comet Way, Inc.</I></P></BODY></HTML>
