Object Manager
==============

This is a demonstration of how to use the Object Manager. It creates
writes, reads, and destroys Props in the resident object manager.
Currently, there are two types of object managers:

To use the Object Manager (memory resident) type:
ak 200_ObjectManager.agent 300_ObjectManagerTest.agent

To use the File Object Manager (saves to filesystem) type:
ak 201_FileObjectManager.agent 300_ObjectManagerTest.agent
